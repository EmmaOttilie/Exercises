I wanted to make some sort of pattern and express the error as something "off" or different in the pattern. I found a colour that I liked and started making ellipses in a set pattern, so the error would stand out more. I made my error the "404" text because I find it funny that is has layers of meaning, in that it is both an error in the picture and a message of error online, cf. "404 not found". 
I'm not sure what constitutes a program. As of right now my understanding of a program is basically anything with coding(?)
An error
