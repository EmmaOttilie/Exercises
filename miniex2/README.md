I wanted to make some sort of pattern and express the error as something "off" or different in the pattern. I found a colour that I liked and started making ellipses in a set pattern, so the error would stand out more. I made my error the "404" text because I find it funny that is has layers of meaning, in that it is both an error in the picture and a message of error online, cf. "404 not found". 

I'm not sure what constitutes a program. As of right now my understanding of a program is basically anything with coding(?)

To me, an error is something unintentional. Errors can definitely turn out to be great things, but we rarely plan errors ahead. Errors or glitches in everyday life are mostly inconvenient and annoying, since they often slow down or stop our tasks. In development errors can be crucial to figure out new ways and improve on projects. We learn from our mistakes. But to intentionally make errors are foreign to me, and it was quite hard to come up with a concept to showcase an error. The more you think about what constitutes an error, the bigger the term seems to get. So I ended up with something very simple so my brain would'nt melt.
