A) My idea was to keep it pretty simple and just tweak the classic spinner. I've decided to keep the pink colour in all my exercises, to make a story of how my coding is developing throughout this course. So expect a lot of that.

Initially I wanted a text, a spinner and a sound, but my spinner would be rectangles rotating on two axes. Turns out that is ridiculously hard to do, so I had to make each individual rectangle draw and redraw itself by certain variables (shout-out to the Trash Dove).
Then there was this whole thing with the opacity, and after struggling to make the rectangles rotate as I invisioned them, turns out I liked the "glitchy" ones better, so I kept those. My original idea is still in the code on line 101 and 102 if anyone wants to turn it back on and see.

I decided I wanted a soundtrack and played around with a couple of songs, but landed on this one. I feel like it compliments the tone of this throbber and my feelings so far in coding. Actually just my brain in general. 

B) How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture? Lemme get back to you on that.
