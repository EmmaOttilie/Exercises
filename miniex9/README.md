For some reason, GitHub will NOT show the working program due to some HTTPS issue, just like Winnies example. To run the program, please download the index file and the sketch file and paste those files into a working p5.js folder. 

A)  We made a program that showcase the current temperature of 4 countries in pink bubbles. Additionally we made buttons that, when pressed show the current temperature in celcius degrees as well. We got the data and API from Open Weather because our we had major problems with the API of our original idea, and wanted an API that we could basically write directly from Shiffmanns video 8.5. 

B)  This exercise was really frustrating. Our initial idea had to be scrapped because of WHO KNOWS! We had the API, we had the JSON file and everything looking right in the code. But p5 would not call the file. We tried literally evertyhing to make it work. After that failure we just set aout to get some data to showcase in the program and made it as easy as possible by chosing some data from the given exercis and follow Shiffman. We still had some minor issues, but the program called the file correctly, and so we settled on this. 
Acquiring the API was fine, no problems there. The problem was entirely with processing the data and showcasing it. 

C)  The aesthetics of big data.
