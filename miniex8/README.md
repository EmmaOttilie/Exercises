A)  I made my own original code in stead of changing a coding challenge. I call it Kitty AI.

B)  This program includes variables, functions of mousepressed and mousedragged and a counter. It also includes a button, an image and a sound.

C)  The difficulty of this weeks exercise was the flowchart. I had minor issues with my code, but I chose to make a simple program, so everything was fixable. Breaking the code down into steps was fine. To me it was trying to figure out what constitutes a "decision" or an "input" in a flowchart was the hard part. I ended up with this flowchart that I think represents the program pretty clearly.
