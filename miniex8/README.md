A)  I made my own original code instead of changing a Shiffman coding challenge. I call it Kitty AI.

B)  This program includes variables, functions of mousepressed, mousedragged and a counter (to make the sound play only once, in stead of repeatedly on top of itself). It also includes a button, an image and a sound.

C)  The difficulty of this weeks exercise was the flowchart. I had minor issues with my code, but I chose to make a simple program, so everything was fixable. Breaking the code down into steps was fine. To me it was trying to figure out what constitutes a "decision" or an "input" in a flowchart was the hard part. I ended up with this flowchart that I think represents the program pretty clearly.

D)  Flowcharts can be a tool to break down something and to show the inner workings of it. There are procudural issues in everything when you break it down into pieces and it can give us a better understanding of these things. Flowcharts can be used to describe reality, as a perspective, as a design tool and to structure things. We can use them retorically to open up systems and see how they work. Wether a programmed coding system or a social system. This is a means to start and further communication about how things work, which generally is a great thing.
