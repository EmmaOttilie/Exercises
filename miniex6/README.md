B)  As a generative program, it works. New branches are created (tree.push) in angles (dir.rotate) in relation to the previous branch, using Vector, each time mouse is pressed. BUT

I had SO many ideas for this exercise and this tree was just the starting point. I’ve spent the most time on this one and have my most (to me) disappointing result, so this damn tree represents a lot of frustration.
I wanted to make the tree grow, I kinda succeeded in that.
I wanted to make the tree branches smaller in stroke with each mouse press. Didn’t happen.
I wanted the colour of each new branch to gradually get darker with each mouse press. Didn’t happen. 
I wanted multiple trees growing in different sizes and colours, at different positions in the canvas. Also didn’t happen. 
Then I thought, well at least I can make the tree stop growing and then subtract branches with mouse press! Nope. Couldn’t even make that work.

C)
My thought proces in this exercise was that I wanted to create a mix of interactivity and generativity. 
To me, generative software is something that encourages unanticipated change through contributions. So you can do something with it, but also just watch as the program does something on its own. That is why I wanted the colour changes and the branches to get smaller.
