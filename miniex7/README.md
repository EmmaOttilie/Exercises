B.1)  General notions of objects. It makes it possible to contain all your data and functionality of an entity all wrapped up in a piece of code. It makes it easier to organize objetcs and their data. 

B.2)  Advantages of using objects. The oppertunity to class together objects based on their concept or aspects is an advantage. It works kinda like a recipy or definition for an object and can be very helpful in that you can call them in varied ways throughout the code and ca do iteration through the constructor functions. Time/life-saver when you have a lot of code. There's definitely benefits in being able to code objects in class! 

B.3)  My experience with objects were limited. I never got a great idea on how to use it in this program. I used objects far more satisfactory in my miniex6 and found it very helpful. 

C)  I made a mini game using checkboxes and sliders from the .dom library. My idea was to make it so you could only "win" the game when you found the correct combination of checkboxes, slidervalues and then clicked the right button. But I ran out of time, so for now, it's just about finding the right checkboxes. I made the sliders dance just to make it look more interesting. The "YAY prize" is my object.
