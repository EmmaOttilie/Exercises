C)  This is my plan B, which to me is really annoying. I really quickly figured out that I wanted to make a program based on a wall from the TV show "Stranger Things", where a boy communicates between dimensions through christmas lights. Initially I wanted to make a game where the user could spell out words by hovering the mouse over different lighbulps, but that doesn't present feedback within the program, only feedback between the program and the user. Instead I made it so the wall spell out a message to the user. Two words repeated again and again. 
In terms of coding, the feedback loop consists of the lightbulps in relation to each other. One lights up when one shuts off and so on. Furthermore, the program loops within itself based on framecount. 

My issues with this piece is largely due to not being able to find/figure out the right functions to perform my ideas. I imagened the wall to both spell out a message and to be interactive so that the user could write out messages too, but I could not make it work as i had envisioned it. I've struggled with colour, with the mouse hover and especially with the soundtrack, which is frustrating because that worked perfectly in my previous exercise. This time around it was quite an ordeal, but ended up being fixed by using a local python server. 
All in all okay with this piece. It works fine, it's just not what I set out to do.

Also, this isn't pink, which strays from my idea of a theme of pink in all my exercises. But when an idea strikes, it can't be contained by pinkness.
