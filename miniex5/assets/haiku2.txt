She has left me on the train
Flying around in in the sky
Staring into the abyss
Petting me on my biceps
GlaDos is Chells mum (spoiler)
Cherry blossom reflections
Ice hangs from my frosty nose
The blueness remembers you
Ledgers Joker is the best
Save me from this hellish place
Knitting sweaters of real hair
Dancing naked in the rain
Subs not dubs for hentai please
There’s a taco in my purse
Dragonflies on a night sky
Starry nights and violins
Camping trips are so much fun
Why won’t you come back to me?
Shrek is love and Shrek is life
Saw your brother on Grindr
