This program generates haiku poems when you press the mousebutton. 

C) Turns out I didn't use RiTa at all, even though I thought I did.
I put the library in my index and had it working when I started out, but as I made the program, all my functions and syntax was actually already in the p5 library. I didn't notice till I was nearly done and did't want to make a whole new program. So.. Yeah. 

D) I had a lot of fun with this one. I got the idea for the haikus pretty quickly and just had to figure out how to make it. My text isn't found material, I made my own instead of having to find a bunch of haikus. Using a txt file and calling it worked fine, I just had to seperate the three lines of text into three files and call them individually to make sure I kept the haiku format when it randomizes the phrases. 

My issues with this program was purely aeshetic. I wanted the text to look a certain way and act a certain way, so I played around with different ways of achieving this. Initially I wanted a single word within the line of text to be black, using the match function. But that turns the entire line black. I had a LOT of trouble finding out how to change this, looking through references and examples. When I finally figured out how it was possible (asking Winnie), and tried writing this into my code, I kept getting errors and never actually made it work. So I stuck with the working program that shows an entire line of black text instead of just the word. :-/ Compromising can be hard!
At least I have a working haiku generator! And we're back to pink. 

E) Concerning materialty in text and interfaces. When text is digital media, you can do so much more with it, than you can with a printed text. The textual character can be changed as you read it and make it convey different visual effetcs depending on the meaning of the text. The text becomes more than just the words and their meaning, and the media becomes equal to or more importat than the text itself.
